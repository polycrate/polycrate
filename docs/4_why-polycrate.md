# Why Polycrate

- Simple commands to execute complex, pre-configured deployment or installation logic
- No need to locally install abstract toolchains and conflicting dependencies when working with tools like Ansible, Kubernetes or Terraform
- No knowledge of the logic of single blocks is necessary to use the exposed actions
- Build complex but well-integrated systems based on a single configuration file
- No custom DSL or complex configuration structure to learn: Polycrate lets you build on your own terms with minimum constraints, giving you the ability to configure your workspace and blocks the way YOU need to
- Share the operational load of managing complex systems in production with your team
- Works with and improves existing tools - no need to rewrite existing code to work with Polycrate. Just make a block out of it and expose it as an action
- Use tools like Ansible to achieve idempotent deployments inside your blocks
- Share common logic by pushing blocks to an OCI-comptabible registry
- Share workspaces through git-repositories
